## Backup Location

All original configurations are backed up to:
```
~/.ultrathink_backups/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

## How It Works

1. **Backup Phase**: Saves current configs locally and from remote servers
2. **Analysis Phase**: Parses configuration files to understand current setup
3. **Reddit Phase**: Fetches top posts from terminal-related subreddits
4. **Optimization Phase**: Merges current setup with Reddit best practices
5. **Generation Phase**: Creates new optimized configuration files
6. **Installation Phase**: Installs missing tools on all systems
7. **Sync Phase**: Pushes to git and syncs across all machines

## Safety Features

- Creates timestamped backups before any changes
- Validates configurations before applying
- Handles OS-specific differences automatically
- Skips VS Code SSH sessions for tmux auto-start
- Uses non-destructive merging (keeps your customizations)

## Customization

After running UltraThink, you can further customize by editing:
- `~/.zshrc.local` - Local ZSH additions
- `~/.tmux.local.conf` - Local tmux overrides
- `~/dotfiles/config/starship.toml` - Prompt customization

## Troubleshooting

### Tools not installing on remote servers
- Ensure you have sudo access
- Check internet connectivity
- Some tools may need manual installation

### Configuration not applying
- Run `source ~/.zshrc` after installation
- Restart tmux sessions
- Check for syntax errors in generated configs

### Reddit fetching fails
- Use `--skip-reddit` flag
- Check internet connectivity
- Reddit API may be rate limited

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Vim/Neovim configuration optimization
- [ ] VS Code settings sync
- [ ] Automatic cron job for regular updates
- [ ] Configuration rollback feature
- [ ] Custom theme selection
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
